# Creative-Coding-Midterm
# This project contains a squiggly line object and ghost object that act independently of one another on the canvas
# Each object is organized within a separate class (Ghost.js and BendSquiggly.js) and called within the sketch.js file
# When the user's mouse is pressed, the array of ghost objects is displayed on the canvas before disappearing
